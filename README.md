Things not Working
- Colors are still switching
- No way to reset

Things to be Added
- Page Formatting
- No such thing as too many comments
- Reduce sample size when new distribution is used
- Input for the scale
- Drop the initial agents?

For the threshold
- Future work
	- Threshold for triggering new distribution
		Since we use the example of locating adversarial agents, we want to use a threshold at which the agent can react knowing that it will trigger a new distribution.
